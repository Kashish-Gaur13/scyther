1. About Scyther

Scyther bla Cas andsoforth, bla Lutger, yada yada yada.

2. Requirements
---------------

Scyther compilation depends on a few external items:

- A C compiler (gcc or anything modern *nixy will do)
- The Flex and Bison scanner/compiler generation tools.
- The argtable 2 library.

The first two requirements are usually met by default by any modern *nix
variant, such as GNU/Linux. 

The argtable2 library is available under the LGPL license from
http://argtable.sourceforge.net/doc/argtable2.html. Make sure the paths
in the Makefile include the path to this library.

If you want LaTeX output we need

- LaTeX
- The MSC macro package msc.sty

For the documentation generation, optionally with graphs.
- Doxygen: http://www.doxygen.org/
- Dot: http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/
