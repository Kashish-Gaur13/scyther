Windows users that already have the Python language installed are
advised to follow the generic installation procedure (detailed in

are not sure) whether you already have python, the following two steps
will get Scyther up and running:

  freely downloaded from:

	http://www.graphviz.org/

  Download the latest stable release and install it.

2.2. Install Enthought Python

  Visit:
  	
	http://code.enthought.com/enthon/#download

  Download the latest release at the bottom of the page, and install it.
  Note that this is a fairly large file (+- 125 MB) which can take a
  while to download.

2.3. Start scyther

  Double-click:

  	scyther-gui.py

  In the directory where you found this file.


3. Linux
