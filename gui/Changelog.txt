- Scyther changelog -
---------------------

Scyther 1.0-beta6 
	
	* Added Mac support (added universal binary)
	* Fixed bug in scripting backend (e.g. with mpa.py)
	* Added claim parameter for Reachable claim; Reachable,R means
	  that role R should be trusted (as well as the actor), but not
	  any other claim. This can be useful for showing stronger
	  authentication properties of protocols with more than two
	  parties.

Scyther 1.0-beta5 

	* Change of switch semantics.  '--max-attacks=N' now defines the
	  maximum number of attacks per claim.  Previously this was a
	  global maximum for all claims combined.
	* Improved attack graph output.
	* added switch '--errors=FILE' to redirect standard error output
	  to a file.
	* Rewrote parts of the gui code for improved stability.

Scyther 1.0-beta4 

	* (Changelog starts after the release of Scyther 1.0-beta4)
