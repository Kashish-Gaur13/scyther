Mac

MacPorts (Martijn)

- Easy

Fink (Christoph)

- Lots of stuff problematic, probably easiest to install elementtree locally into the Scyther directory. (package-rev/elementtree into Scyther)

- Leave Python version as is, install dot/graphviz, wx seems to be there already.

- pythonw needed to start for screen access
